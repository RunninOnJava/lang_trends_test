OptionsCity customers include professional traders, proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, and large financial institutions. OptionsCity fosters a culture of innovation and leadership in the financial technology space. With over 50 employees, OptionsCity now has offices in New York and London, in addition to corporate headquarters in Chicago, IL.</p>\n\n<p>OptionsCity Metro, an end-to-end electronic platform for trading and managing risk was launched in 2007 and  awarded the \u201cBest Options Trading Platform\u201d by Wall Street Letter. In 2011, OptionsCity innovated again with Freeway, a low-latency algorithmic trading platform that accelerates the process of building, testing, and executing multi-asset strategies. Freeway was named a 2012 Chicago Innovation Award winner. </p>\n\n<p>In the beginning of 2015 OptionsCity launched Metro NOW, the next generation of its flagship platform, which allows users to build and buy by combining built-in execution, risk management and pricing functionality with a growing library of custom in-house widgets. </p>\n\n<p>Originally launched in 2012, the OptionsCity City Store is \u201cThe Marketplace of the Trading World\u201d. City Store is a collaborative ecosystem where OptionsCity, third-party developers and customers can interact by building and purchasing custom widgets and bringing a new level of personalization to the trading experience. The City Store integrates seamlessly with our Metro NOW platform, turning it into the new method of deploying functionality to the customers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our Culture:</strong> At OptionsCity we win through continuous innovation and taking care of our people. Here\u2019s what you can expect as a member of the OptionsCity family.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Big ideas and big changes:</strong> Even after eight years of growth and three successful products, we continue to drive innovation with major launches of our software. As a tech startup, we are not afraid (at an executive team level or a developer level) of taking calculated risks in order to push our products forward. It also helps that we are voracious competitors \u2013 once our developers see how an innovative idea to change one of our products can strengthen our leadership position, they become single-mindedly focused on making that idea a reality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Passion for technology (and Java):</strong> Our people include major open source contributors, authors of coding books and JavaOne conference speakers. Our team is passionate about our software, about technology and about Java.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurial intensity:</strong> To realize our growth potential we need people who enjoy identifying problems, asking tough questions, and rolling up their sleeves to tackle difficult challenges. As you might imagine, customers in the financial industry demand the best performance to help them remain competitive - and that\u2019s our mission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family of owners:</strong> We hire genuinely friendly people to make OptionsCity a nice, fun place to work. And we make it natural to act in the best interest of the company, to act like owners, by giving you a piece of the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Growing yourself with the company:</strong> We\u2019re as proud of developing our people as we are of our company\u2019s success. We\u2019ll push you into new roles with more responsibility and opportunities to learn (and teach). And to help you build new skills and contacts we even offer a $4,000 annual education benefit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Great Team:</strong> In addition to Friday happy hour, we have company-sponsored team-building activities, internal competitions, charity events, and a company softball league!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Great Benefits:</strong> Besides equity incentives and tuition reimbursement we offer health, dental, vision, 401K, life, long term disability and commuter plans, Monday morning breakfasts, and lunch + beverages provided daily.</p>\n","how_to_apply":"<p><a href=\"http://atsod.com/j/s.cfm/3H8\">http://atsod.com/j/s.cfm/3H8</a></p>\n","company":"OptionsCity Software","company_url":"http://www.optionscity.com","company_logo":"http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/bb568390-0868-11e5-91bf-3338c59760c6.png","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/ec952640-0869-11e5-83c4-b5e35b69d4bc"}]
